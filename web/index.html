commerce and social medias with invisible layers behind what is being
shown on the monitor of mobile phones/ tablets/ laptops and smart TVs  .
By clicking on top of an image that is being shown on the screen of
your device, you will be able to connect and interact with these hidden
layers . You can tag things on them and then send that image with
what you wrote on and post it on your social media network. 
The same goes for advertisements, by clicking on top of an item it
will say what it is ,what brand it is and where to buy it close to where your
at . All these infos are hidden in these invisible layers.
Basically there are two layers. One for advertisements and
informations and the second for social interaction.
This opens a whole new world of advertising possibilities.
